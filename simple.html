    <p>Front end and back end are terms used by programmers and computer professionals to 
        describe the layers that make up hardware, a computer program or a website which are 
        delineated based on how accessible they are to a user. In this context, the user refers 
        to an entity that could be human or digital.

        The back end refers to parts of a computer application or a program's code 
        that allow it to operate and that cannot be accessed by a user. Most data and operating 
        syntax are stored and accessed in the back end of a computer system. Typically the code is 
        comprised of one or more programming languages. The back end is also called the data access 
        layer of software or hardware 
        and includes any functionality that needs to be accessed and navigated to by digital means.</p>
